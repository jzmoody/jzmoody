- Hi, I’m @jzmoody
-  I’m interested in data science, machine learning, and exploring data-driven solutions to real-world problems.
-  I’m currently learning advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep learning and natural language processing.
-  I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to predictive modeling, data analysis, and AI applications.
-  Fun fact: I'm fascinated by the intersection of epidemiology and data science and enjoy applying statistical methods to understand health trends in populations.
